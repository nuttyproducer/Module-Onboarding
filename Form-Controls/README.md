## Task

We are selling t-shirts. Write a form to collect the following data:

Our customers already have accounts, so we know their addresses and charging details already. We don't need to collect that data. We want to confirm they are the right person, then get them to choose a colour and size.

Writing that out as a series of questions to ask yourself:

1. What is the customer's name? I must collect this data, and validate it. But what is a valid name? I must decide something.
2. What is the customer's email? I must make sure the email is valid. Email addresses have a consistent pattern.
3. What colour should this t-shirt be? I must give 3 options. How will I make sure they don't pick other colours? 
........You mean color duplicates, to not select two colors i guess?
4. What size does the customer want? I must give the following 6 options: XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL

All fields are required.
Do not write a form action for this project.

## Developers must test their work.
